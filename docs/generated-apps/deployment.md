# Deployment

After implementing your business logic, we recommend deploying your website to the cloud.
Deploying your website to the cloud allows people to view your website by visiting a URL.

## Azure App Service

One way to deploy is using Azure App Service. This service will allow you to deploy and scale web, mobile and API apps.

## Web Template Studio: Deploy App command

NOTE: Make sure that the [Web Template Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WASTeamAccount.WebTemplateStudio-dev-nightly) and [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) extensions are installed in visual studio code.

The easiest way to deploy an application generated with Web Template Studio is to use the `Web Template Studio: Deploy Application` command. To execute this command, follow these steps:

1. Open the application generated with Web Template Studio in Visual Studio Code.
   
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux or `Command âŒ˜ + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.
   
3. In the Command Palette, type `Web Template Studio: Deploy App` and press `Enter` to launch the deploy.

Web Template Studio will begin preparing the application for deployment. You can see the progress in the Visual Studio Code output. In addition, a notification will be launched for each step executed.

 - It will run the `npm install` command to install all the necessary dependencies for the frontend and the backend apps.

 - Create a Production Build: This step will creates a build directory with a production build of your frontend app.

 - Copy the build directory to `server/build`, so the `server` folder will contain all the necessary frontend and backend files for the deployment.

 - Web Template Studio will then automatically launch the command `Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App...`, which will be in charge of deploying the application to an Azure App Service.

    - If you have added an Azure App Service when creating your application with Web Template Studio, the application already has a deployment configuration, so it will use the created Azure App Service.

    - Otherwise, Visual Studio Code will ask you for the deployment directory and if you want to create a new Azure App Service or use a previously created. 
    
       **IMPORTANT**:exclamation: -  Remember to select the `server` folder for deployment to be successful.

  - Start the application deployment to Azure App Service. We can see the progress of the deployment in the output of the Azure App Service extension.

  - At the end of the deployment, Visual Studio Code shows us a notification that the deployment has been successful.
